Project MyHashMap :
1. Implemented my own Quadratic hashing hashtable and used the horner rule to map the various words read from the dictionary of lenght 100,000.
2. Implemented grid game where we check for the possible words in the dictionary in eight directions from that letter in the grid.
3. Compared performances of HashMap dictionary vs AVL tree dictionary vs Linkedlist Dictionary.

Project MyBinarySearchTree :
1. Implemented my own binarysearchtree by writing code for various methods like remove, compareStructures, IsMirror, rotate Left, rotate Right , Copy, etc.

Project Linkedlist :
1. Implemented my own linkedlist with methods like swap, right shift ,left shift, insertList, Erase, find n th element from the end

Project Generics:
1. Implemented various logics using the concept of Generics and how it improves the efficiency of code across various datatypes comparsion etc.
